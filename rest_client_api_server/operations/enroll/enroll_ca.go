/* EnrollCa swagger:route POST /enroll/ca Enroll enrollCa

Enroll an identity with a pre-exchanged certificate

For CA auto enrollment, an identity is not created beforehand.
Instead one will be created during enrollment. The client will present a client certificate that is signed by a
Certificate Authority that has been added and verified (See POST /cas and POST /cas/{id}/verify).

During this process no CSRs are requires as the client should already be in possession of a valid certificate.

# By having an 'edge' section defined, the ziti-controller will attempt to parse the edge configuration. Removing this
# section, commenting out, or altering the name of the section will cause the edge to not run.

  # This section represents the configuration of the Edge API that is served over HTTPS
  api:
    # (required) The interface and port that the Edge API should be served on.

# Config Format Version
#
# Whenever a breaking change is made to the semantics of this configuration file, the configuration version
# expected by the controller will be incremented. When the controller tries to load a configuration file with
# an incompatible version, it will abort with a message prompting the operator to seek out the breaking changes
# documentation.

v: 3

# Identity
#
# Define all of the paths to the certificates and key required to establish the controller's identity.
#
identity:
  cert:                 etc/ca/intermediate/certs/ctrl-client.cert.pem
  server_cert:          etc/ca/intermediate/certs/ctrl-server.cert.pem
  key:                  etc/ca/intermediate/private/ctrl.key.pem
  ca:                   etc/ca/intermediate/certs/ca-chain.cert.pem


# Network Configuration
#
# Configure how the controller will establish and manage the overlay network, and routing operations on top of
# the network.
#
#network:
  #
  # routeTimeoutSeconds controls the number of seconds the controller will wait for a route attempt to succeed.
  #
  #routeTimeoutSeconds:  10
  #
  # createSessionRetries controls the number of retries that will be attempted to create a circuit (and terminate it)
  # for new sessions.
  #
  #createSessionRetries: 3  
  #
  # Defines the period that the controller re-evaluates the performance of all of the sessions
  # running on the network.
  #
  cycleSeconds:         15
  #
  #smart:
    #
    # Defines the fractional upper limit of underperforming sessions that are candidates to be re-routed. If 
    # smart routing detects 100 sessions that are underperforming, and `smart.rerouteFraction` is set to `0.02`,
    # then the upper limit of sessions that will be re-routed in this `cycleSeconds` period will be limited to 
    # 2 (2% of 100). 
    #
    #rerouteFraction:    0.02
    # 
    # Defines the hard upper limit of underperforming sessions that are candidates to be re-routed. If smart 
    # routing detects 100 sessions that are underperforming, and `smart.rerouteCap` is set to `1`, and 
    # `smart.rerouteFraction` is set to `0.02`, then the upper limit of sessions that will be re-routed in this 
    # `cycleSeconds` period will be limited to 1.
    #
    #rerouteCap:         4  

# Database Location
#
# Define the path to where the controller's database will be stored.
#
db:                     /tmp/devctrl.db

# Overlay Tracing
#
# Record message traces of all messages captured on any channel (`ctrl` or `mgmt`) in "dump" format to the
# specified path. The `ziti-fabric trace dump` utility will convert this binary dump file into a human-readable
# explanation of the messages that were sent and received by the controller.
#
#trace:
#  path:                 ctrl.trace

# Profiling
#
# Enable and configure memory and CPU profiling for the controller. See `go tool pprof` for information on how 
# to work with this profile data.
#
#profile:
  #memory:
    #path:                ctrl.memprof
    #
    # Defines the interval at which memory profiling snapshots will be recorded.
    #
    #intervalMs:          15 
  #cpu:
    #path:                ctrl.cpuprof

# Control Channel Configuration
#
# Define the listener for the control (`ctrl`) channel.
# 
ctrl:
  listener:             tls:127.0.0.1:6262
    #options:
      # (optional) settings
      # set the maximum number of connect requests that are buffered and waiting to be acknowledged (1 to 5000, default 1000)
      #maxQueuedConnects:      50
      # the maximum number of connects that have  begun hello synchronization (1 to 1000, default 16)
      #maxOutstandingConnects: 100
      # the number of milliseconds to wait before a hello synchronization fails and closes the connection (30ms to 60000ms, default: 1000ms)
      #connectTimeoutMs:       3000

# Management Channel Configuration
#
# Define the listener for the management (`mgmt`) channel.
#
mgmt:
  listener:             tls:127.0.0.1:10000
    #options:
      # (optional) settings
      # set the maximum number of connect requests that are buffered and waiting to be acknowledged (1 to 5000, default 1000)
      #maxQueuedConnects:      50
      # the maximum number of connects that have  begun hello synchronization (1 to 1000, default 16)
      #maxOutstandingConnects: 100
      # the number of milliseconds to wait before a hello synchronization fails and closes the connection (30ms to 60000ms, default: 1000ms)
      #connectTimeoutMs:       3000

# Metrics Configuration
#
# Configure any additional handlers for metrics data in the controller. In the current configuration, there is only
# an `influxdb` handler, which will store metrics data as InfluxDB series.
#
# See `github.com/openziti/fabric/metrics` for more information on extending the controller with additional
# metrics handlers.

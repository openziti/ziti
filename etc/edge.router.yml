# (required) The certificates, ca chains, and private key used to represent this routers identity
#
# If the 'edge" section is enabled and enrollment is run, the files in this section will be written to with the results.
# The "key" value can be provided through any of the support private key engines (file, etc.).
#
# If the 'key' value is a file and that file exists; it is expected to a pre-generated private key. It will be used for
# the  enrollment process and it will back the certificates generated during enrollment. If the file does not exist, it
# will be generated.
#
# The 'cert', 'server_cert', and 'ca' files will be overwritten with the results of the enrollment process.
#
# When running the ziti-router the files/values in this section will be read and used. The 'cert' value will be used
# as the client certificate to connect to the controller. The 'server_cert' is used for all servers/listeners. The
# 'ca' value is used to populate an internally Trusted CA pool.

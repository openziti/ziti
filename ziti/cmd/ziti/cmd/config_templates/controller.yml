# By having an 'edge' section defined, the ziti-controller will attempt to parse the edge configuration. Removing this

  api:

    # activityUpdateBatchSize: 250

    # API requests and connections that are maintained to Edge Routers
    sessionTimeout: 30m

  enrollment:

    # A Ziti Identity configuration section that specifically makes use of the cert and key fields to define
    # a signing certificate from the PKI that the Ziti environment is using to sign certificates. The signingCert.cert
    # will be added to the /.well-known CA store that is used to bootstrap trust with the Ziti Controller.

# web
# Defines webListeners that will be hosted by the controller. Each webListener can host many APIs and be bound to many
# bind points.
web:
  # name - required
  # Provides a name for this listener, used for logging output. Not required to be unique, but is highly suggested.
  - name: client-management
    # bindPoints - required
    # One or more bind points are required. A bind point specifies an interface (interface:port string) that defines
    # where on the host machine the webListener will listen and the address (host:port) that should be used to
    # publicly address the webListener(i.e. mydomain.com, localhost, 127.0.0.1). This public address may be used for
    # incoming address resolution as well as used in responses in the API.
    bindPoints:
      #interface - required
      # A host:port string on which network interface to listen on. 0.0.0.0 will listen on all interfaces
      - interface: 0.0.0.0:{{ .ZitiEdgeCtrlPort }}
        # address - required
        # The public address that external incoming requests will be able to resolve. Used in request processing and
        # response content that requires full host:port/path addresses.
        address: {{ .ZitiEdgeCtrlAPI }}

    # Allows the webListener to have a specific identity instead of defaulting to the root 'identity' section.

    options:

      # The maximum amount of idle time in milliseconds allowed for pipelined HTTP requests. Setting this too high

      # will cause clients to reconnect on subsequent HTTPs requests.

      # readTimeoutMs - optional, default 5000ms
      # The maximum amount of time in milliseconds http servers will wait to read the first incoming requests. A higher
      # value risks consuming resources on the host with clients that are acting bad faith or suffering from high latency
      # or packet loss. A lower value can risk losing connections to high latency/packet loss clients.
      readTimeout: 5000ms
      # writeTimeoutMs - optional, default 10000ms
      # The total maximum time in milliseconds that the http server will wait for a single requests to be received and
      # responded too. A higher value can allow long running requests to consume resources on the host. A lower value
      # can risk ending requests before the server has a chance to respond.
